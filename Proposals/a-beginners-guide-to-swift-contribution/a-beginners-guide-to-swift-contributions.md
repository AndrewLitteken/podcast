# A Beginner's Guide to Contributing to Swift

* Proposal: [PR#22](https://github.com/SwiftCommunityPodcast/podcast/pull/22)

* Authors: [Andrew Litteken](https://github.com//AndrewLitteken)

* Review Manager: Unassigned

* Status: Proposal Pending

* Date of Recording: TBA

## Introduction

There is a lot of talk about contributing to Swift. But how can you actually start? This episode is to help new members of the community learn to navigate the history of the project, understand the boundaries, find a project to work on and the best way to reach out to the community for help.

## Motivation

Since this podcast is about engaging with the commmunity and growing the community as well, this episode is supposed to emphasize the more technical aspect of the compiler development community where the previous episode emphasized the surrounding community that uses Swift.

## Proposed contribution

I propose to co-produce the episode with Garric as mentioned in issue [38](https://github.com/SwiftCommunityPodcast/podcast/issues/38). See #Roles section below for open roles.

## Source compatibility

This episode fits with the overall theme of the podcast in the following ways:
- highlights how to get involved in Swift devlopment
- a new voice looking to get involved
- helps get more people involved in the project
- drive contributions to another community project
